title: Space station
---

Imagine a space station, to which we attach a reference frame $I$. We assume that this frame is inertial over the time scale we will consider. Around this space station moved a satellite, to which we attach a frame $S$. Inside that satellite is a gyroscope, whose body $B$ can rotate freely with respect to the satellite thanks to a [gimbal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal).

1. Show that the angular velocity of the body with respect to the space station, expressed in the satellite frame, satisfies:

$$
{}_S \omega_{IB} = {}_S \omega_{IS} + R_{SB} {}_B \omega_{SB}
$$
